title: Using Code Hike within the app directory
summary: How to use Code Hike with the new app directory of Next.js 13

I'm using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/),
with [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) and
for the code listing i'm using the wonderful [Code Hike](https://codehike.org/) library.

Next.js 13 had some problems with the usage of contentlayer and the app directory,
but this issues are fixed with the version 13.0.3 of Next.js.

But as i tried to integrate Code Hike,
the application fails with the following error `TypeError: ke.createContext is not a function`.

We can fix the error, by making our Markdown component a [client component](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#client-components) e.g.:

```tsx Markdown.tsx mark=1
"use client";

import { useMDXComponent } from "next-contentlayer/hooks";

type Props = {
  code: string;
};

const Markdown = ({ code }: Props) => {
  const MDXComponent = useMDXComponent(code);
  return (
    <div className="prose prose-zinc">
      <MDXComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Markdown;
```

The essential part is the first line.
The `use client` makes the component to a [client component](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#client-components).
With this separate component we are able to use Code Hike.
