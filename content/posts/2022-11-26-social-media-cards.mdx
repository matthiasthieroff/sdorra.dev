Recently I added social media cards to this blog.
Social media cards are images which are displayed,
when you or someone else post a link to your content on a social media platform.
Posts with a nice looking image are more often clicked, as those without an image.
Lets see how we can implement them.

## Possible implementations

I've implemented social media cards many times before and
I've used many different technics to implement them,
but all of them had their downsides.

### Manually creation

The simplest way is to create the social media cards manually.
Just open [figma](https://figma.com/) or a similar tool and create a card for each post.
This approach works, but it is very error prone and time consuming.
We had to remember to create a new card, every time we create a new post.

### Node Canvas

Another approach is it to create a background image and
insert the texts and the metadata with a canvas library like [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas).
This approach is very well described in [this Learn With Jason episode](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/generate-dynamic-images-with-node-canvas).
But with a canvas library we have to specify on which coordinates we want to render our texts and
it does not wrap automatically if it becomes to long.

### External service

We could also use an external service like [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
The [post of Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/auto-generate-social-image/) describes this approach very detailed.
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) is able to break texts on a certain width,
but the api is not very intuitive and the largest part of the card is an image which must be build with an external tool.

### SVG and opentype.js

With an SVG we can define our image as code, which is pretty neat.
But SVG is not able to wrap texts.
We can use [opentype.js](https://opentype.js.org/) to calculate the width of our texts and to wrap it manually.
Finally we have to convert the SVG to a PNG, because the most of social media platforms do not support SVG.
This approach could work, but requires a lot of code and it is very complicated.

### Headless browser

If all these solutions have problems with wrapping of texts or requires us to build the image with an external tool,
why we could just use HTML+CSS to define our image.
This is possible!
We can create our card with HTML+SVG+CSS, open a browser and create a screenshot of the result.
I've use this approach in the [past](https://github.com/scm-manager/website/blob/master/src/lib/socialSharingCards.js) and it works well.
The problem is that process is very slow.
[This example](https://github.com/scm-manager/website/blob/master/src/lib/socialSharingCards.js) creates the cards during the build.
Creating the cards during the build requires external caching, because is slows down the build extremely.
Generating cards with this approach in a serverless function is often not possible,
because it requires a browser within the function which breaks breaks the size limit of those functions.

### @vercel/og

`@vercel/og` promises a new way of generating social media cards, which does not have the downsides of the other approaches.
The library uses [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) under the hood.
[Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) describes itself as follows:

> Enlightened library to convert HTML and CSS to SVG.

We can use HTML+SVG+CSS to create an Image without the requirement to start a browser for an screenshot.
This sounds like the solution I've been looking for.
So let us try it out.

## Hello World

First we have to install the package from the npm registry:

```bash
pnpm add @vercel/og
```

After the installation we have to create an edge function, which renders our social media card.

```tsx pages/api/og.tsx
import { ImageResponse } from "@vercel/og";

export const config = {
  runtime: "experimental-edge",
};

export default function () {
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          fontSize: 128,
          background: "white",
          width: "100%",
          height: "100%",
          display: "flex",
          textAlign: "center",
          alignItems: "center",
          justifyContent: "center",
        }}
      >
        Hello world!
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 1200,
      height: 600,
    }
  );
}
```

This was easy, so lets try to create something more complicated.

## The goal

I've headed over to [figma](https://www.figma.com/) and started to create an example social media card.
I've ended with the following:

![Figma template](/posts/2022-11-26-social-media-cards/template.png)

Ok, now lets see if we can implement it with `@vercel/og`.

## The implementation

The first hurdle that I had to overcome, was the usage of custom fonts.
The figma template uses [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) and [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin).
This are the same fonts which are used on the website.

### Fonts

Unfortunately we can't use the [@next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/font) package with Satori.
So we have to copy the font files to our project.

<Notification>
  It looks like Satori has problems with dynamic fonts. Therefore only static fonts should be used and we have to load
  each used weight separately.
</Notification>

In an edge function we can't access the filesystem, but we can use `fetch` to load the fonts:

```tsx pages/api/og/[slug].tsx
const ralewayBold = fetch(new URL(`../../../../content/fonts/Raleway-Bold.ttf`, import.meta.url)).then((res) =>
  res.arrayBuffer()
);

const cabinSemiBold = fetch(new URL(`../../../../content/fonts/Cabin-SemiBold.ttf`, import.meta.url)).then((res) =>
  res.arrayBuffer()
);

const cabinMedium = fetch(new URL(`../../../../content/fonts/Cabin-Medium.ttf`, import.meta.url)).then((res) =>
  res.arrayBuffer()
);
```

Than we have to define them on the `ImageResponse` config:

```tsx pages/api/og/[slug].tsx
return new ImageResponse(<div>...</div>, {
  width: 1200,
  height: 675,
  fonts: [
    {
      name: "Raleway",
      data: await ralewayBold,
      style: "normal",
      weight: 700,
    },
    {
      name: "Cabin",
      data: await cabinMedium,
      style: "normal",
      weight: 400,
    },
    {
      name: "Cabin",
      data: await cabinSemiBold,
      style: "normal",
      weight: 600,
    },
  ],
});
```

After we have load the fonts we can use them in our jsx:

```tsx
<div style={{ fontFamily: '"Cabin"' }}>Hello from Cabin</div>
```

<Notification>
**Note** the extra double quotes around the font name,
those are required and the font is not used without them.
</Notification>

### Tailwind

`@vercel/og` offers experimental Tailwind support and
I love Tailwind so I decided to use it.

In order to use Tailwind utilities, we can use the `tw` attribute on any element e.g.:

```tsx
<div tw="rounded-xl border-2 border-zinc-700 shadow-lg"></div>
```

The first problem I've noticed is that my Tailwind config was not used.
It looks like `@vercel/og` uses the default config and
ignores the configuration of the project.

The second problem I've noticed is that not all utilities seams to work.
I'm not sure whats the reason for that, but some utilities work and other not.
For example the gradient utilities are not working, although the CSS properties are supported by Satori.
Maybe utilities that use CSS variables are not supported?
However the following utilities I want use are not working as expected:

- bg-gradient-\*, from-\*, via-\* and to-\*
- object-cover
- rotate-\*

Another problem took me some time.
In a normal Tailwind project,
the Tailwind preflight is loaded,
which removes the default browser margins and paddings from each element.
This does not happen for `@vercel/og`,
which took me some time to figure out where are spacings come from.
I've fixed it by just using `div` and `span` tags.
Semantics of elements could be ignored here,
because in the end we create an image and all the elements are gone.

By the way, the `debug` option on the `ImageResponse` is pretty handy.
If it is used, every element becomes a colored border,
which helps to identify which element takes how much space.

Ok, enough about problems and workarounds here is the code:

```tsx pages/api/og/[slug].tsx
import { ImageResponse } from "@vercel/og";
import { allPosts } from "contentlayer/generated";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export const config = {
  runtime: "experimental-edge",
};

const ralewayBold = fetch(new URL(`../../../../content/fonts/Raleway-Bold.ttf`, import.meta.url)).then((res) =>
  res.arrayBuffer()
);

const cabinSemiBold = fetch(new URL(`../../../../content/fonts/Cabin-SemiBold.ttf`, import.meta.url)).then((res) =>
  res.arrayBuffer()
);

const cabinMedium = fetch(new URL(`../../../../content/fonts/Cabin-Medium.ttf`, import.meta.url)).then((res) =>
  res.arrayBuffer()
);

const Image = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const slug = req.nextUrl.pathname.replace("/api/og/posts/", "");
  const post = allPosts.find((p) => slug === p._raw.flattenedPath);
  if (!post) {
    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({
        message: "Could not find post with slug: " + slug,
      }),
      {
        status: 404,
      }
    );
  }

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        tw="w-full h-full p-8 flex"
        style={{
          backgroundImage: "linear-gradient(to right, #0891B2, #164E63)",
          fontFamily: '"Cabin"',
        }}
      >
        <div tw="rounded-xl border-2 border-zinc-700 w-full h-full p-4 flex bg-zinc-800 shadow-lg">
          <img
            width="375"
            height="575"
            src={post.image}
            tw="rounded-xl border-2 border-zinc-700"
            style={{ objectFit: "cover" }}
          />
          <div tw="flex flex-col px-6 w-[740px] h-full justify-between">
            <div tw="flex flex-col">
              <span
                tw="text-7xl font-bold text-zinc-50 mb-6"
                style={{
                  fontFamily: '"Raleway"',
                }}
              >
                {post.title}
              </span>
              <span tw="text-5xl text-zinc-300">{post.summary}</span>
            </div>
            <div tw="flex justify-between items-end w-full text-zinc-400 text-xl">
              <span>{post.readingTime}</span>
              <div
                tw="flex text-4xl font-bold"
                style={{
                  fontFamily: '"Raleway"',
                }}
              >
                <span tw="text-zinc-50">sdorra</span>
                <span tw="text-cyan-400">.dev</span>
              </div>
              <span>{post.date.substring(0, post.date.indexOf("T"))}</span>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div
            tw="w-32 h-32 border-t-2 border-t-zinc-700 border-l-2 border-l-zinc-700 bg-zinc-800 rounded-full absolute left-[324px] bottom-[59px]"
            style={{
              transform: "rotate(-45deg)",
            }}
          />
          <div tw="absolute left-[338px] bottom-[68px] flex items-center">
            <img
              tw="rounded-full border-2 border-zinc-700"
              width="110"
              height="110"
              src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493333"
            />
            <p tw="ml-6 text-4xl font-semibold text-zinc-400">Sebastian Sdorra</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    ),
    {
      width: 1200,
      height: 675,
      debug: false,
      fonts: [
        {
          name: "Raleway",
          data: await ralewayBold,
          style: "normal",
          weight: 700,
        },
        {
          name: "Cabin",
          data: await cabinMedium,
          style: "normal",
          weight: 400,
        },
        {
          name: "Cabin",
          data: await cabinSemiBold,
          style: "normal",
          weight: 600,
        },
      ],
    }
  );
};

export default Image;
```

With about 120 lines of code I was able to create the following image:

![Result](/posts/2022-11-26-social-media-cards/result.png)

Now it is time to deploy it to vercel.

### Edge function size limit

The first deployment to vercel ends with the following error:

<Notification type="error">
  <strong>Error:</strong> Provided Edge Function is too large
</Notification>

It took me some time to figure out what is going on.
I've create a [separate post](http://localhost:3000/posts/2022-11-24-contentlayer-mdx-edge) about this problem and my workaround.

### Unsplash image size

After I bypassed the size limitation of the edge function,
the deployment went through but the og endpoint ends with an error 500.
The error in the vercel log does not help at all.
So I started to look at the code and start commenting out some parts of the code and
it took not very long to find out that the post image is the problem.
It looks like another size limitation.
The image is loaded from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and is about `7mb` large.
Luckily [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has an api to resize the image,
so we could fetch the image in exactly the size we need.

```tsx pages/api/og/[slug].tsx
const createImageUrl = (src: string, width: number, height: number) => {
  if (src.startsWith("https://images.unsplash.com/") && !src.includes("?")) {
    return `${src}?fit=crop&w=${width}&h=${height}`;
  }
  return src;
};

<img
  width="375"
  height="575"
  src={createImageUrl(post.image, 375, 575)}
  tw="rounded-xl border-2 border-zinc-700"
  style={{ objectFit: "cover" }}
/>;
```

After this fix we are able to generate social media cards on our production site.

## Meta tags

Now it is time to link our social media cards in the header of our post page.
So that the social media networks are able to find the image.
For this we are creating a `head.tsx` file with the following content:

```tsx app/posts/[slug]/head.tsx
import { allPosts } from "contentlayer/generated";

type Props = {
  params: {
    slug: string;
  };
};

const fqdn = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FQDN ? process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FQDN : "sdorra.dev";

const Head = ({ params }: Props) => {
  const post = allPosts.find((p) => p._raw.flattenedPath === params.slug);
  if (!post) {
    return null;
  }
  return (
    <>
      <title>{post.title}</title>
      <meta name="description" content={post.summary} />

      <meta name="og:title" content={post.title} />
      <meta name="og:description" content={post.summary} />
      <meta property="og:image" content={`https://${fqdn}/api/og/posts/${post._raw.flattenedPath}`} />
      <meta property="og:type" content="article" />

      <meta name="twitter:title" content={post.title} />
      <meta name="twitter:description" content={post.summary} />
      <meta property="twitter:image" content={`https://${fqdn}/api/og/posts/${post._raw.flattenedPath}`} />
      <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
    </>
  );
};

export default Head;
```

We use [og tags](https://ogp.me/) which are accepted by the most of the social media sites.
Expect Twitter, I've had strange results if I used only `og` with Twitter.
So I've added the Twitter tags beside the `og` tags.

<Notification>
  Ensure that the image url is an complete url with scheme and hostname.
  The most social media sites do not render images with an relative url.
</Notification>

Now we can test the results with [socialsharepreview](https://socialsharepreview.com/).

## Conclusion

Even if there are a few stumbling blocks with `@vercel/og`,
it is the best solution for social media cards if worked with so far.
